L2 Frontend Assignment for Mono Software


This is finished assignment for Mono Software with Firebase/Firestore and with React Hooks.
I have not been able to implement MobX due to my lack of knowledge and experience of MobX.

P.S. 
Since I am pretty sure they will not read this, I can focus on my plans and finding/dealing with my mistakes :D

First thing first, I did massively underestimate Redux and MobX as state managment libraries!
I did think that with React Hooks I won't need to dvelve further into Redux, and in this case, MobX, of whom
I first heard doing this project. At best, I just thought of Redux (and MobX) as overcomplication in every sense.
And I was certain, that since React Hooks deals with state in it's own way, that I will just have to "copy-paste"
that logic into MobX! Until I have seen documentation and found out that there is no newer YT tutorial on it!
I can find newer tutorials on Redux, but MobX? If it is React Native, sure! Otherwise, it's 2~4 years old YT video.
Reading documentation did not help either! I just had this feeling, that MobX is geared to someone who already had
some experience with state managment (that was not React Hooks ofc). I did find Mono Software's blog posts from 2019 and 
2020, I think? In older one, it was MobX project that was asked of me to do. And disregarding the fact that I want to get 
a job, I did even think of copying all that code and submitting it as my project! If I can't do it with my own knowledge 
and skill then I would rather admit defeat than cheat.

Since I did pour my soul over another mistake in my path to becoming good web dev, I did find solution, kinda.
I will do Redux tutorial, both one on Traversy Media (the one from 2021) and try to find one from freeCodeCamp, that is 
newer and will deal with functional React components. Then after doing those 28 React projects, on which I will practice Redux
as well, I will then do MobX, because I did notice many companies actually use it.

And of course, do few React projects with OOP -.- I really hate class based react components!
