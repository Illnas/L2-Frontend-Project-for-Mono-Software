L2 Frontend Assignment for Mono Software


This is finished assignment for Mono Software with Firebase/Firestore and with React Hooks.
I have not been able to implement MobX due to my lack of knowledge and experience of MobX.

P.S. 
Since I am pretty sure they will not read this, I can focus on my plans and finding/dealing with my mistakes :D

First thing first, I did massively underestimate Redux and MobX as state managment libraries!
I did think that with React Hooks I won't need to dvelve further into Redux, and in this case, MobX, of whom
I first heard doing this project. At best, I just thought of Redux (and MobX) as overcomplication in every sense.
And I was certain, that since React Hooks deals with state in it's own way, that I will just have to "copy-paste"
that logic into MobX! Until I have seen documentation and found out that there is no newer YT tutorial on it!
I can find newer tutorials on Redux, but MobX? If it is React Native, sure! Otherwise, it's 2~4 years old YT video.
Reading documentation did not help either! I just had this feeling, that MobX is geared to someone who already had
some experience with state managment (that was not React Hooks ofc). Also I did find Mono Software's blog posts from 2019 and 
2020, I think? In older one, it was MobX project that was asked of me to do. And disregarding the fact that I want to get 
a job, I did think of copying all that code and submitting it as my project but if I can't do it with my own knowledge 
and skill then I would rather admit defeat than cheat.

Since I did pour my soul over another mistake in my path to becoming good web dev  some time ago, I did find solution, eventually.
So now I will do Redux tutorial, both one on Traversy Media (the one from 2021) and try to find one from freeCodeCamp, that is 
newer.
